Project Description:
The BB313 is a breadboard platform for the ATTiny2313/4313 microcontroller. 
It’s designed to make the prototyping process easier by providing a regulated 
5V power supply, an AVR-ISP programming header, an FTDI-cable compatible 
6-pin header, connections for an external ceramic resonator, and a reset 
button on the PCB, so you don’t need to wire those functions up on the 
breadboard. It breaks out most of the pins on the ATTiny to one side, so you 
have more breadboard space to work with. It also doubles as a target board for 
the 2313/4313 and, with a simple modification, the ATTiny25/45/85.

I created it because I use the Tiny2313 a lot, and I was tired of wiring up 
all of the above each time I wanted to work on a new circuit. Some things, 
like ISP headers and ceramic resonators, are not especially breadboard friendly. 
Further, I found that with larger projects breadboard space started to get a 
little cramped, and I wanted to maximize the prototyping area. By putting it 
all on a custom PCB, I save a lot of breadboard space and things are more 
straightforward. It also gives me a complete support platform that I can embed 
straight into a project.
